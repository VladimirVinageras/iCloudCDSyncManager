# CoreDataSyncManager

CoreDataSyncManager is a lightweight and powerful Swift package for synchronizing Core Data with iCloud using CloudKit. It simplifies the management of data across multiple devices, supporting both automatic and manual synchronization modes. With built-in offline support, conflict resolution, notifications, and data deletion features, this package is ideal for applications that require reliable and seamless data management.

## Features
**Automatic and Manual Sync Modes** 

    Easily switch between automatic and manual synchronization modes to fit your appâ€™s workflow.

**Full Core Data and iCloud Integration**

    Uses NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to synchronize Core Data changes with iCloud, ensuring your data is always up-to-date across devices.
    
**Offline Support with Network Monitoring**

    Monitors network status using NWPathMonitor to detect connectivity changes. Automatically synchronizes when the connection is restored.

 **Conflict Resolution Strategies**
 
    Handles conflicts between local and iCloud data with configurable options to prioritize either local or cloud data.

**Data Deletion Capabilities**

    Supports full iCloud data deletion and can configure automatic data removal on app reinstallation to ensure fresh starts.

**User Notifications**

    Uses UNUserNotificationCenter to notify users of synchronization status, errors, or completed syncs, enhancing user experience.

**Optimized for Testing**

    Supports in-memory Core Data stores to enable fast and reliable unit testing without needing a persistent model or physical iCloud connection.
